            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <p>Maddie's Mark is a not-for-profit foundation dedicated to helping people enjoy their "best days ever," inspired by the vibrant spirit of Madeline Musto.</p>
            <h2>Maddie's Story</h2>
            <p>Madeline Musto was a five-year-old kindergartener—independent, kind, and mature beyond her years. In 2012, she was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), an inoperable brain stem tumor. Her family shifted focus to creating "best days ever" filled with family, friends, crafts, and adventures. Madeline passed peacefully on February 8, 2012, surrounded by loved ones, teaching everyone to cherish every moment.</p>
            <p>The foundation was established in early 2012 by her parents, Erin and Matthew Musto, to honor her legacy of love and kindness.</p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To spread Madeline's spirit by providing opportunities, creating environments, and enabling children and families to enjoy their "best days ever" through acts of kindness and support.</p>
